        <h2>Why do we use it?</h2>
        <p>
          It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the
          readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of
          using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of
          letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it
          look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web
          page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a
          search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their
          infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by
          accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

          "Neque porro quisquam est qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet,
          consectetur, adipisci velit..." "There is no one who loves pain
          itself, who seeks after it and wants to have it, simply because it is
          pain..."

            What's 75 million years old and brand spanking new? A teenage
            Utahceratops! Come to the Saroyan, armed with your best dinosaur
            roar, when Scott Sampson, Research Curator at the Utah Museum of
            Natural History, steps to the podium. Sampson's research has focused
            on the ecology and evolution of late Cretaceous dinosaurs and he has
            conducted fieldwork in a number of countries in Africa. <br /><br />

            Scott Sampson is a Canadian-born paleontologist who received his
            Ph.D. in zoology from the University of Toronto. His doctoral work
            focused on two new species of ceratopsids (horned dinosaurs) from
            the Late Cretaceous of Montana, as well as the growth and function
            of certopsid horns and frills.

          Following graduation in 1993, Sampson spent a year working at the
          American Museum of Natural History in New York City, followed by five
          years as assistant professor of anatomy at the New York College of
          Osteopathic Medicine on Long Island. He arrived at the University of
          Utah accepting a dual position as assistant professor in the
          Department of Geology and Geophysics and curator of vertebrate
          paleontology at the Utah Museum of Natural History. His research
          interests largely revolve around the phylogenetics, functional
          morphology, and evolution of Late Cretaceous dinosaurs. <br /><br />

          In addition to his museum and laboratory-based studies, Sampson has
          conducted paleontological work in Zimbabwe, South Africa, and
          Madagascar, as well as the United States and Canada. He was also the
          on-air host for the Discovery Channel's Dinosaur Planet and recently
          completed a book, Dinosaur Odyssey: Fossil Threads in the Web of Life,
          which is one of the most comprehensive surveys of dinosaurs and their
          worlds to date.
