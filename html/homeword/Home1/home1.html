          Today, JavaScript is used on most of the pages of a modern website,
          from small individual sites to the largest commercial sites. And
          wherever JavaScript is used, you’ll also find jQuery.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s why every web developer should know how to use JavaScript and
          jQuery for what they do best.
