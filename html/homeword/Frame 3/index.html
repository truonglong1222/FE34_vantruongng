              What's 75 million years old and brand spanking new? A teenage
              Utahceratops! Come to the Saroyan, armed with your best dinosaur
              roar, when Scott Sampson, Research Curator at the Utah Museum of
              Natural History, steps to the podium. Sampson's research has
              focused on the ecology and evolution of late Cretaceous dinosaurs
              and he has conducted fieldwork in a number of countries in Africa.

              Scott Sampson is a Canadian-born paleontologist who received his
              Ph.D. in zoology from the University of Toronto. His doctoral work
              focused on two new species of ceratopsids (horned dinosaurs) from
              the Late Cretaceous of Montana, as well as the growth and function
              of certopsid horns and frills.

              Following graduation in 1993, Sampson spent a year working at the
              American Museum of Natural History in New York City, followed by
              five years as assistant professor of anatomy at the New York
              College of Osteopathic Medicine on Long Island. He arrived at the
              University of Utah accepting a dual position as assistant
              professor in the Department of Geology and Geophysics and curator
              of vertebrate paleontology at the Utah Museum of Natural History.
              His research interests largely revolve around the phylogenetics,
              functional morphology, and evolution of Late Cretaceous dinosaurs.

              In addition to his museum and laboratory-based studies, Sampson
              has conducted paleontological work in Zimbabwe, South Africa, and
              Madagascar, as well as the United States and Canada. He was also
              the on-air host for the Discovery Channel's Dinosaur Planet and
              recently completed a book, Dinosaur Odyssey: Fossil Threads in the
              Web of Life, which is one of the most comprehensive surveys of
              dinosaurs and their worlds to date.
