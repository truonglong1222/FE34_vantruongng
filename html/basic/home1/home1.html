            Today, JavaScript is used on most of the pages of a modern website,
            from small individual sites to the largest commercial sites. And
            wherever JavaScript is used, you’ll also find jQuery.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s why every web developer should know how to use JavaScript and
            jQuery for what they do best.
